									<h2>Brandon Maser</h2>
									<p>I'm a Graphic Designer with over 8.5 years of experience 
										in print production working with a B2B company while making files for 
										in house and outsourced projects. Though my primary focus is in Illustrator &
										Photoshop, I have a multitude of self-taught experience/education in
										Web Design, Brand Management, Marketing, Graphic Design, & Production Design. Currently
										in the process of learning UX Design. </p>

										<h2>Print Production</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/Production.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/Production.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Made specialized files for digital printing (EPS / SVG / PSD / PDF), sending files out to vendors for ordering in tools and dies (EPS / DXF / PDF), 
										and creating special files for all different types of machines and processes (Back-saved EPS & AI). Working with so many files, I created standard 
										naming & organization strategies for all aspects of a project from file naming, resource listing, e-mail format and server backups.

										<h2>Screen Printing</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/Screening.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/Screening.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Out of flattened images, I had to create all screening separations for up to 5 different colors and test print to make sure everything would turn out right
										based on the halftone. If everything looked in order, I would then create filmwork to get shot in screens. My experience with a multitude of different art
										results in a clear understanding of how the screen printing process works and how to get the best outcome for both large and small scale products.</p>

										<h2>Design Work</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/Design.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/Design.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Working and creating a basic understanding in several programs, I tried to push out different concepts of design work. Maya for 3-D renders learning framework
										and model limitations, InDesign for instruction booklets, Illustrator for clean edged design, and Photoshop for carrying a statid design theme. Only a small
										sample of my work so far, I look forward to larger projects with more driven experience in these programs to expand my sight and abilities over time.</p>

										<h2>Illustrations</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/Illustration.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/Illustration.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Illustrated art has such a unique look that is crisp and clean. On projects I work on for both restoration or preparation for art, a clean high quality
										background stands out above everything else. A fun side project I work on regularly to keep my Illustrator skills brushed up for any project that comes
										my way.

										<h2>Advertising</h2>

									</br>
									<p>Was always told I have a voice for radio & great writing skills. So I combined the two and worked with a local radio station to release commercials for a
									shoppe located in Kansas. Above is a sample of just one, but have been making commercials for years to help spread the message they want to communicate."</p>

										<h2>Brand Management</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/Brand.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/Brand.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>From small businesses to self-starters. I help create a theme and identity behind their brand to relay the story they wish to tell. I prefer the simplistic and
										minimalistic design, however customers can sometimes want wild ideas and you settle for the middle-ground. After all, the story is the owners side to tell.
